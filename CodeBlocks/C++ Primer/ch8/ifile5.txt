< — Directs the contents of a fi le to the command. In most cases, this is the default
action expected by the command and the use of the character is optional; using
less bigfile is the same as less < bigfile.
> — Directs the standard output of a command to a fi le. If the fi le exists, the
content of that fi le is overwritten.
2> — Directs standard error (error messages) to the file.
&> — Directs both standard output and standard error to the file.
>> — Directs the output of a command to a file, adding the output to the end of the existing file.

| less - to see a text file line by line

echo $PS1 - defines shell prompt
     $MAIL - location of mail box
     $SHELL - Shell location

BASH - This contains the full pathname of the bash command. /bin/bash.

BASH_VERSION - represents the current version of the bash command.

EUID - This is the effective user ID number of the current user. based on the user’s entry in the /etc/passwd file.

FCEDIT - If set, this variable indicates the text editor used by the fc command. If this variable isn’t set, the vi command is used.

HISTFILE - This is the location of your history file. $HOME/.bash_history.

HISTFILESIZE - The oldest commands are discarded. The default value is 1000.

HISTCMD - This returns the number of the current command in the history list.

HOME - This is your home directory.

HOSTTYPE - the computer architecture on which the Linux system is running.

MAIL - This is the location of your mailbox file. /var/spool/mail directory.

OLDPWD - The directory that was the working directory before you changed to the current working directory.

OSTYPE - This name identifies the current operating system. For Fedora Linux, the

OSTYPE - value is either linux or linux-gnu.

PATH - This is the colon-separated list of directories used to find commands that you type. Typically includes the following: /bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/
bin:/usr/bin/X11:/usr/X11R6/bin:~/bin. 

PPID - This is the process ID of the command that started the current shell.

PROMPT_COMMAND - This can be set to a command name that is run each time before your shell
prompt is displayed. Setting PROMPT_COMMAND=date lists the current date/
time before the prompt appears.

PS1 - This sets the value of your shell prompt. with the variables PS2, PS3, and so on.
PWD - This is the directory that is assigned as your current directory. 

RANDOM - Accessing this variable causes a random number to be generated. The
number is between 0 and 99999.
SECONDS - This is the number of seconds since the time the shell was started.

SHLVL - This is the number of shell levels associated with the current shell session.
When you log in to the shell, the SHLVL is 1. Each time you start a new bash
command (by, for example, using su to become a new user, or by simply
typing bash), this number is incremented.

TMOUT - This can be set to a number representing the number of seconds the shell
can be idle without receiving input. After the number of seconds is
reached, the shell exits.

$(ls | wc -w) - For directory file count
lpr & - run process in background
; - chain together multiple commands
Ctrl+F - Character forward Go forward one character.
Ctrl+B - Character backward Go backward one character.
Alt+F - Word forward Go forward one word.
Alt+B - Word backward Go backward one word.
Ctrl+A - Beginning of line Go to the beginning of the current line.
Ctrl+E - End of line Go to the end of the line.
Ctrl+L - Clear screen Clear screen and leave line at the top of the screen.

Ctrl+D - Delete current Delete the current character.
Backspace - Delete previous Delete the previous character.
Ctrl+T - Transpose character Switch positions of current and previous characters.
Alt+T - Transpose words Switch positions of current and previous words.
Alt+U - Uppercase word Change the current word to uppercase.
Alt+L - Lowercase word Change the current word to lowercase.
Alt+C - Capitalize word Change the current word to an initial capital.
Ctrl+V - Insert special character Add a special character. For example, to add a Tab
character, press Ctrl+V+Tab.
Ctrl+K - Cut end of line Cut text to the end of the line.
Ctrl+U - Cut beginning of line Cut text to the beginning of the line.
Ctrl+W - Cut previous word Cut the word located behind the cursor.
Alt+D - Cut next word Cut the word following the cursor.
Ctrl+Y - Paste recent text Paste most recently cut text.
Alt+Y - Paste earlier text Rotate back to previously cut text and paste it.
Ctrl+C - Delete whole line Delete the entire line.
